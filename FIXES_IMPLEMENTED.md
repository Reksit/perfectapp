# Issues Fixed - September 6, 2025

## Summary of Problems Fixed

### 1. Alumni Profile Network Connection Count Not Updating ✅

**Problem**: After alumni accept/reject connection requests, the connection count displayed in the dashboard stats wasn't updating automatically.

**Root Cause**: 
- The frontend was using cached connection counts from the User model instead of fresh database queries
- The backend wasn't forcing a refresh of connection counts after changes

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Backend Changes:
- **ConnectionService.java**: Added force refresh after accepting connection requests
- **AlumniController.java**: Modified `/alumni/stats` endpoint to get fresh connection counts directly from database instead of cached field

#### Frontend Changes:
- **ConnectionRequests.tsx**: Removed page refresh (`window.location.reload()`) and replaced with custom event
- **AlumniDashboard.tsx**: Added event listener for 'connectionUpdated' events to refresh stats automatically
- **ConnectionManager.tsx**: Removed page refresh and added custom event trigger

### 2. Entire Page Refreshing When Connection Accepts/Rejects ✅

**Problem**: When alumni accepted or rejected connection requests, the entire page would refresh unnecessarily.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced `window.location.reload()` calls with custom events
- Components now listen for 'connectionUpdated' events and refresh only their data
- Much smoother user experience with no full page reloads

### 3. Professor Department Not Found Issue ✅

**Problem**: Professors were seeing "Professor department not found. Please contact administration." when trying to view attendance, even though their department was properly stored in the database.

**Root Cause**: 
- The login response wasn't including department information
- Frontend AuthContext wasn't storing department field from login response

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Backend Changes:
- **LoginResponse.java**: Added new fields (department, className, phoneNumber, verified)
- **AuthService.java**: Updated login method to include all user fields in response

#### Frontend Changes:
- **AuthContext.tsx**: Updated login function to store all user fields including department

## Technical Details

### Connection Count Refresh Logic:
```java
// Force fresh calculation from database
networkConnections = connectionRepository.findAcceptedConnectionsByUserId(alumni.getId()).size();
```

### Event-Based Updates:
```javascript
// Trigger update event instead of page refresh
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('connectionUpdated'));

// Listen for updates
window.addEventListener('connectionUpdated', handleConnectionUpdate);
```

### Complete User Data in Login:
```javascript
const userData = {
  id: response.id,
  email: response.email,
  name: response.name,
  role: response.role,
  department: response.department,  // Now included
  className: response.className,    // Now included
  phoneNumber: response.phoneNumber, // Now included
  verified: response.verified,      // Now included
};
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Connection Count Updates**: 
   - Login as an alumni
   - Go to alumni directory and send connection requests
   - Login as recipient and accept/reject requests
   - Check that dashboard stats update without page refresh

2. **No Page Refresh**: 
   - Accept/reject connection requests
   - Verify page doesn't refresh but stats update smoothly

3. **Professor Department**: 
   - Login as the professor "Mohamed Hussain M" (department: "Electronics and Communication")
   - Go to attendance management
   - Select a class (I, II, III, IV)
   - Should see students from Electronics and Communication department only
   - No "department not found" error should appear

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `dto/LoginResponse.java` - Added new fields
- `service/AuthService.java` - Updated login response
- `service/ConnectionService.java` - Added force refresh
- `controller/AlumniController.java` - Fresh connection count queries

### Frontend:
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Store complete user data
- `components/features/ConnectionRequests.tsx` - Event-based updates
- `components/features/ConnectionManager.tsx` - Event-based updates
- `components/dashboards/AlumniDashboard.tsx` - Listen for updates

## Result

All three major issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Connection counts update automatically without page refresh
- ✅ No unnecessary page refreshes when accepting/rejecting connections
- ✅ Professor department information is properly available for attendance management

The application now provides a smooth, professional user experience with real-time updates and proper data consistency.
